# cloud-shell
cloud-shell is my development environment for working with cloud providers

It includes cloud provider cli's I use pre-installed and authenticated with my credentials.

It is pushed into a private dockerhub repository.

Its main purpose to make my development os-agnostic, (as long as docker is installed on the computer I work on)
